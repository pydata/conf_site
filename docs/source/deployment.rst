Deployment
==========

Initial Deployment and Creation
-------------------------------

It is assumed that each conference site will run on its own virtual private
server (VPS) running `Debian 10 (Buster)`_. PyData uses Rackspace, but other
VPS providers like DigitalOcean_, Linode_, or `Amazon Lightsail`_ should also
be acceptable.

The user account on the server should have passwordless sudo access.

.. _Debian 10 (Buster): https://wiki.debian.org/DebianBuster
.. _DigitalOcean: https://www.digitalocean.com/
.. _Linode: https://www.linode.com/
.. _Amazon Lightsail: https://amazonlightsail.com/

Suggested Minimum VPS Specifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- 1 VCPU/CPU core
- 1 GB RAM
- 20 GB HDD/SSD space

The Host Variables file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once a virtual server is set up, information related to the conference
should be added into an Ansible host variables file. This file should be
placed in the `ansible/host_vars` directory. The `conf_site` repository
contains `an example file`_ that might be helpful.

.. note::
   Many of these host variables are overridden in local development by
   group variables defined in `ansible/group_vars/development`.

Suggested variables in this file include:

- **ansible_ssh_host**: The IP address of the virtual server.
- **conference_identifier**: An alphanumeric string identifying the conference.
- **conference_name**: The title of the conference.
- **database_user**: The name of the PostgreSQL database user that will be
  created during deployment. For PyData sites, this is the
  `conference_identifer`.
- **date_format**: A string in `Django date/time templating format`_
  explaining how dates should be formatted on the conference site.
- **django_database**: The name of the PostgreSQL database that will be
  created during deployment. For PyData sites, this is generally the
  `conference_identifer`.
- **google_analytics_id**: A valid `Google Analytics tracking ID`_.
- **subdirectory**: By default, this is the same as the `conference_identifier`
  (with a preceding slash).
- **time_format**: A string in `Django date/time templating format`_
  explaining how times should be formatted on the conference site.
  American sites use "`g:i A`", while European sites use "`G:i`".
- **timezone**: The conference site's timezone. This should be in
  `tz database format`_.
- **website_domain**: The domain where the conference site is located. For
  PyData sites, this should always be *pydata.org*.
- **website_url**: The full URL of the conference site. For PyData sites, this
  should be a subdirectory of pydata.org.

.. warning::
   It is assumed that conference sites are in a subdirectory of
   another website, connecting through a `reverse proxy`_. If this is not the
   case, modifications will need to be made to the nginx server configuration
   file templates in the `ansible/roles/web/templates/` directory so that
   the conference site will load properly.

Updating the Host Inventory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To ensure that code is deployed to the aforementioned VPS, its name
needs to be added to the Ansible hosts file (located at `ansible/hosts`_).

For PyData sites, a listing with the conference identifier should be added
to the `production` group. For other sites, the entire `production` group
should be replaced with your own server(s).

.. _ansible/hosts: https://github.com/pydata/conf_site/blob/main/ansible/hosts

The Secrets File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The repository includes an encrypted `Ansible Vault`_ file at
`ansible/secrets.yml` containing sensitive variables that cannot
be included in plaintext. Non-PyData users should replace this file with
their own variables file. An example of the file and its format can
be found at `ansible/secrets.yml.example`.

.. _Ansible Vault: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_vault.html

Required variables include:

- **database_password**: The PostgreSQL database password.
- **django_secret_key**: The `Django SECRET_KEY setting`_.
- **email_host_name**: The hostname of the SMTP server that sends email
  from the conference site.
- **email_host_password**: The password of the SMTP server. The username
  is defined in the Jinja template file for sensitive settings at
  `ansible/roles/web/templates/sensitive-settings.py` (`EMAIL_HOST_USER`).
- **upstream_server_ip**: The upstream server working as a reverse proxy
  for this conference website.

.. _Django SECRET_KEY setting: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/settings/#std:setting-SECRET_KEY

Deploying
~~~~~~~~~

Deployment occurs by running the `ansible-playbook` command::

    ansible-playbook ansible/production.yml -l gotham2017,metropolis2017

.. warning::
   Make sure that your virtualenv is activated (`workon conf_site`)
   before trying to deploy.

.. note::
   The optional `-l` parameter limits the deployment to a specific host
   or group of hosts.

Customization
-------------

There are a number of steps to get a new conference site ready. Most of these
steps are not necessary to be run manually for PyData conference sites.

- **Create additional Django administrator accounts if necessary.** The
  easiest way to do this is to login with the master admin account
  (using the admin email address defined in `ansible\group_vars\all` and
  the admin password defined in the Ansible Vault file) in the Django admin
  (in the `cms` subfolder of the conference site's URL) and adding users.
- **Load fixtures to help set up sites.** While the data in these fixtures
  are specific to PyData sites, it is a good idea for other users to edit
  and run them as well to `avoid possible issues`_. If not using Ansible,
  you need to manually login to the server, navigate to the application
  directory, activate the current virtualenv, and run the Django
  management command to load fixtures::

    ssh <conference site IP address>
    cd /srv/pydata
    source ~/.virtualenvs/current/bin/activate
    DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="conf_site.settings.production" ./manage.py loaddata fixtures/*

- **Update the conference name in the Django admin**.
- **Change the name of the Django Site in the Django admin**.
- **Open the Symposion proposal sections** if the call for proposals is
  already open. Change "Closed" to "No" in
  `admin/symposion_proposals/proposalsection/`.
